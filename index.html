				Hi I'm Lucci, a front end developer and artist from Southern California. I'm passionate about coding clean, functional and elegant solutions in the form of websites. Currently I work as a freelancer in web development/design and as a graphic designer for an educational YouTube channel with over 150,000 subscribers.
				<br><br>
				I've been messing around with HTML and CSS since the Myspace days; I was obsessed with page customization. At the end of my senior year in high school, I decided to buckle down and learn how to program. I started out with Python on Codecademy and Coursera, then later took different college courses in C, Java, Ruby, Ruby on Rails and Javascript. However, those courses didn't provide enough depth or practical knowledge for me to feel confident in making my own projects; I didn't know where to start!
				<br><br>
				After a couple of hiatuses from coding (that were spent working restaurant jobs and traveling), I decided it was best for me to narrow my learning to front end development. The artistic design aspects of web development have always appealed to me most; I just really enjoy making things look cool. Since then, I've been enthusiastically upgrading my skills with freeCodeCamp, Udemy courses and a few trusting website clients.

					<p class="portfolio__description">
						Solario is a vanilla JS web app that helps the user protect their skin from the sun's harmful rays. This was the first time I used WebPack and Babel in my build process; tricky to get the hang of but it really facilitated my development workflow. The app uses the Geolocation Web API along with the SunCalc and Moment.js libraries to display the sun's altitude at the user's current position and time. Depending on the altitude, it also displays advice on whether to avoid sun exposure and facts about UV rays and the sun. As someone who is interested in skincare and health, this app is very useful to me; I built this for myself. :)

				<p class="portfolio__description">This was my first time building a multi-page site with well-organized Sass files and npm; this workflow was just awesome. Upon visiting the website, you will see that CSS grid and transitions are my best friends. The site has a minimal, modern design that is cohesive with the client's brand and taste (as well as my own). For the contact form I had to dabble in a bit of PHP for the first time and it seemed to function as desired. I also designed the simple logo in Photoshop and edited most of the photos in Lightroom. My client/partner and his online following are very impressed with the results and my ability to meet his deadline.</p>

				<p class="portfolio__description">
					I use Photoshop pretty much on the daily to create appealing, clickable thumbnail designs for In The Mix's twice weekly videos. They have noticeably increased engagement across his social media platforms (videos, website, Instagram, etc). We have also seen nearly a 20% improvement in conversions every month for at least the past 3 months on his channel (in regards to Google Adsense and Amazon Affiliates revenue), and it’s currently at an all-time high. I really enjoy seeing the progession of my design skills across this history of the channel (they used to look terrible)!

				<p class="portfolio__description">Similar to my previous project, I helped set this client up with web hosting and a domain on SiteGround (great customer service and prices, I highly recommend them). I created a child theme from a cool template I found on Wordpress.org, but unlike my last client's theme, this one was very stubborn and difficult for me to modify. I had to implement many workarounds; most of my design was done in the visual customizer in plain CSS, the audio player I created was separated into different parts (an HTML widget, the Additional CSS section, and a Javascript plugin), and the gallery is really just a blog post preview slideshow that I beat into submission. In retrospect, I definitely should have attempted to recreate the theme from scratch in order to have more control. Photoshop was used to create the logo in the top left corner, and Lightroom to edit his photos uniformly for the slideshow gallery. The client seems very satisfied with the results.</p>

				<p class="portfolio__description">This freeCodeCamp project was completed in late 2017. I utilized a JSON call to retrieve objects from the Twitch API, they weren't too difficult to work with thanks to jQuery. I learned more about background attributes in CSS, specifically the blend mode. In making it responsive, I used art direction (just recently learned the term) to display the logo differently on smaller devices. Twitch is a great platform and I often watch streamers, so it was cool to make something that I would use for myself. I still love the design and color palette of this project; I think the result is super cute.</p>

				<p class="reviews__text">"From the initial concept to the final website Lucci went above and beyond to not only create a stunning and professional custom site from the ground up (no templates in sight) but to help me unlock my creativity by suggesting new and innovative website design that I could only have dreamed of. My website took shape faster and more fluidly than I could have imagined without ever feeling like it was out of my hands. She was professional when requesting content for the site (photos and text etc) and helped refine the site into a highly functional, expert design. I highly recommend Lucci for her skills not only in web development, but also graphic design. When paired with her amazing aesthetic vision/taste, your project or website will be in the safest of hands."</p>

				<p class="reviews__text">“Lucci did an amazing job, I am more than happy with the site. Even the logo was exactly what I had in mind. Lucci even coded something unique for the website from an idea I had given her to a finished working player. She even edited all my average photography into professional looking images in a little scrolling  gallery, I mean what can’t she do? The answer: nothing. She loves her work and you can see it from the website and her portfolio. She’s incredible and will do big things, it's been an absolute pleasure talking and working with her through the concepts and website design. My friends and clients love my website and so do I. If you want an up-to-date professional website along with amazing graphics and photos Lucci is who I would recommend.”</p>

Her combination of creative mind and hard work has enabled my website to be more vibrant and lively than I could have imagined. Always quick to answer my questions and reassure me when I didn't know what I wanted, she was so easy to communicate with, and always had a solution. I'm so glad I stumbled upon her, because I wouldn't have been able to create my perfect website otherwise."</p>
