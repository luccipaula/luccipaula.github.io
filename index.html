				Hi I'm Lucci, a front end developer and artist from Southern California. I'm passionate about coding clean, functional and elegant solutions in the form of websites. Currently I work as a freelancer in web development/design and as a graphic designer for an educational YouTube channel with over 100,000 subscribers.
				<br><br>
				I've been messing around with HTML and CSS since the Myspace days; I was obsessed with page customization. At the end of my senior year in high school, I decided to buckle down and learn how to program. I started out with Python on Codecademy and Coursera, then later took different college courses in C, Java, Ruby, Ruby on Rails and Javascript. However, those courses didn't provide enough depth or practical knowledge for me to feel confident in making my own projects; I didn't know where to start!
				<br><br>
				After a couple of hiatuses from coding (that were spent working restaurant jobs and traveling), I decided it was best for me to narrow my learning to front end development. The artistic design aspects of web development have always appealed to me most; I just really enjoy making things look cool. Since then, I've been enthusiastically upgrading my skills with freeCodeCamp, Udemy courses and a few trusting website clients.

				<p class="portfolio__description">This client's website has been my best work yet, I love how it turned out. It was my first time building a multi-page site with well-organized Sass files and npm; this workflow was just awesome. Upon visiting the website, you will see that CSS grid and transitions are my best friends. The site has a minimal, modern design that is cohesive with the client's brand and taste (as well as my own). For the contact form I had to dabble in a bit of PHP for the first time and it seemed to function as desired. I also designed the simple logo in Photoshop and edited most of the photos in Lightroom. My client/partner and his online following are very impressed with the results and my ability to meet his deadline.</p>

				<p class="portfolio__description">Similar to my previous project, I helped set this client up with web hosting and a domain on SiteGround (great customer service and prices, I highly recommend them). I created a child theme from a cool template I found on Wordpress.org, but unlike my last client's theme, this one was very stubborn and difficult for me to modify. I had to implement many workarounds; most of my design was done in the visual customizer in plain CSS, the audio player I created was separated into different parts (an HTML widget, the Additional CSS section, and a Javascript plugin), and the gallery is really just a blog post preview slideshow that I beat into submission. In retrospect, I definitely should have attempted to recreate the theme from scratch in order to have more control. Photoshop was used to create the logo in the top left corner, and Lightroom to edit his photos uniformly for the slideshow gallery. The client seems very satisfied with the results.</p>

				<h4 class="portfolio__title">Pyla Lara</h4>
				<p class="portfolio__description">My first website client needed a CMS for her blog, so I set her up with web hosting and Wordpress. It had been a few years since I'd last worked with WP so I was quite rusty. I had to learn how to transfer domains as well because hers was originally purchased for a Wix site. For the design, I modified a simple theme using the visual CSS customizer and personalized a free Instagram feed plugin I found. She wanted different pages of blog post topics so I created links that corresponded to each post category. I also used Adobe Photoshop to design the banner and resize images to keep the media relatively uniform. According to her extremely generous review (see below), Pyla seems to be very happy with her blog.</p>

				<h4 class="portfolio__title">Twitch Status Viewer</h4>
				<p class="portfolio__description">This freeCodeCamp project was also a bit tricky for me to implement at the time (late 2017), as I was still getting used to CSS grid. Once again I utilized a JSON call to retrieve objects from the Twitch API, they weren't too difficult to work with thanks to jQuery. I learned more about background attributes in CSS, specifically the blend mode. In making it responsive, I used art direction (just recently learned the term) to display the logo differently on smaller devices. Twitch is a great platform and I often watch streamers, so it was cool to make something that I would use for myself. I still love the design and color palette of this project; I think the result is super cute.</p>

				<h4 class="portfolio__title">Local Weather App</h4>
				<p class="portfolio__description">This app was a real challenge for me to build in late 2017. It was tricky to get this particular weather API to work and to think of all of the possible errors that could happen for a user. Getting two different APIs (Google Maps for location and DarkSky for the weather) to work together, using JSON and jQuery, was also an interesting feat. I had to attach a CORS proxy to the API URL to avoid having the browser deny my requests. I believe it was also the first time I used the HTML5 canvas element for the sky icons. Again my love of monochromatic, minimal themes is apparent (along with another sketchy implementation of Bootstrap). I was very proud of this project upon completion.</p>

				<h4 class="portfolio__title">Wikipedia Viewer</h4>
				<p class="portfolio__description">This is a responsively-designed Wikipedia search app built in 2017 as part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum. I used CSS grid to display search results from the Wikipedia API (using an AJAX call) based on user input, in the form of article boxes. The article results also include an introductory sentence, links to each article that open in a new tab and the option to find a random article on Wikipedia.</p>

				<p class="portfolio__description">This is a widget built in 2017 as part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum. I went for a super minimal monochromatic design that is also responsive thanks to Bootstrap, however, my implementation was pretty sketchy. It was my first time working with JSON to call API, and with that I got the quote objects for the widget's main purpose: to generate and display a random quote. I also included a little icon that allows you to tweet the quote provided.</p>

My website took shape faster and more fluidly than I could have imagined without ever feeling like it was out of my hands. She was professional when requesting content for the site (photos and text etc) and helped refine the site into a highly functional, expert design. I highly recommend Lucci for her skills not only in web development, but also graphic design. When paired with her amazing aesthetic vision/taste, your project or website will be in the safest of hands."</p>
